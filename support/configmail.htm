<p>Select the &quot;Start&quot; menu from the task-bar at the bottom of the screen, then select
&quot;Settings&quot;, and then select &quot;Control Panel&quot; from the hierarchical menu.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/ControlPanel.jpg" width="684" height="498"></p>
<p>From the Control Panel folder select the &quot;Mail&quot; icon.</p>
<hr>
<p>The &quot;Internet Accounts&quot; dialog should be displayed.&nbsp; On some systems it may
directly invoke the mail account wizard.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailControl.jpg" width="503" height="309"></p>
<p>Select the &quot;Add...&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p>Enter a name.&nbsp; Don't worry too much about what you put here because we are going to
change it later.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailWizard.jpg" width="543" height="443"></p>
<p>When you have entered a name, select the &quot;Next&gt;&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p>Enter the email address on your domain that you want to be able to use from within Outlook
2000.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailWizAddress.jpg" width="542" height="443"></p>
<p>Select the &quot;Next&gt;&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailWizServerNames.jpg" width="543" height="443"></p>
<p>Make sure the first item on this dialog is &quot;POP3&quot;.&nbsp; Enter &quot;mail.YourDomain.com&quot;
for the &quot;Incoming mail (POP3 or IMAP) server&quot;.&nbsp; For instance if your domain's
name is &quot;PetesStuff.com&quot;, you would enter &quot;mail.PetesStuff.com&quot;.&nbsp; For
the &quot;Outgoing mail (SMTP) server enter the mail server for your ISP (Internet Service
Provider).&nbsp; That is the mail server that you use where you dial-in.&nbsp; Your ISP should
have already provided you with this information.</p>
<p>Select the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailWizLogon.jpg" width="543" height="443"></p>
<p>Enter your account name on YourDomain.&nbsp; This will be the name that you specified in
front of the at-sign &quot;@&quot;.&nbsp; Then specify the password of your email on YourDomain.&nbsp;
This information will be provided to you from Bear Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Select the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailWizConnection.jpg" width="542" height="442"></p>
<p>Select &quot;Connect using my phone line&quot; if you use a modem to connect to the
internet.&nbsp; If you have a hard-line to the internet then select &quot;Connect using my local
area network&quot;.&nbsp; Don't bother selecting the last option.</p>
<p>Select the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailWizDailUp.jpg" width="543" height="444"></p>
<p>Since you should already have a dial-up connection (via your ISP) select the connection that
is correct for you (&quot;My Connection&quot; is just a placeholder for this picture of a
dialog).</p>
<p>Select the &quot;Next &gt;&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p>This will bring up the &quot;Finish&quot; dialog (which has no input).&nbsp; Select the
&quot;Finish&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p>There should now be a new account showing in the &quot;Internet Accounts&quot; dialog with
the name &quot;mail.YourDomain.com&quot;.</p>
<p>Select the newly created account and then select the &quot;Properties&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailPropGeneral.jpg" width="366" height="445"></p>
<p>Under the &quot;General&quot; tab; select the &quot;Mail Account&quot; and replace it with
something more meaningful to you.&nbsp; For instance if you were creating this account to read
your sales account from YourDomain you might want to name it &quot;Sales - YourDomain&quot;.&nbsp;
Don't worry about it though, because you can always come back to this dialog to change it later.</p>
<p>Add the &quot;Reply address&quot; as the same as the E-mail address.</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailPropServers.jpg" width="367" height="445"></p>
<p>Under the &quot;Servers&quot; tab; make sure that it looks similar to the above dialog
(obviously with your information instead of my example information).</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailPropConnection.jpg" width="367" height="446"></p>
<p>Under the &quot;Connection&quot; tab; make sure it looks similar to the example dialog above
(with the exception that your dial-up connection will be the one listed).</p>
<hr>
<p><img border="0" src="images/MailPropAdvanced.jpg" width="367" height="445"></p>
<p>Under the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab; don't bother with anything on this dialog except for the
&quot;Leave a copy of messages on server&quot; check box under &quot;Delivery&quot;.&nbsp; If
you have more than one computer connecting to YourDomain to check the specified account you may
want only one of the computers to actually remove the messages from the server.&nbsp; You see if
the &quot;Leave a copy of messages on server&quot; is not checked whenever you check your mail
all of the messages will be copied to your computer and removed from the server.&nbsp; Then if
someone else checks from a different computer they will not be able to see the messages that you
read.&nbsp; Think carefully about this before setting it one way or the other.</p>
<p>Finally select the &quot;OK&quot; button.</p>
<hr>
<p>You have now added an email account that will check YourDomain mail messages.&nbsp; If you
have other YourDomain mail accounts that you need or want to check, repeat the previous steps.</p>
<p>If you haven't already done so, you will also want to add an account for your standard ISP
mail account.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you have created multiple accounts, in the &quot;Internet Accounts&quot; dialog you will
want to select the account that you want to use by default to send messages with Outlook
2000.&nbsp; Simply select the account, and then select the &quot;Set As Default&quot; button.</p>
<p>Finally select the &quot;Close&quot; button.</p>
