<h2>Configure Multiple Computers to Read Single E-mail</h2>
<p>Many people now have multiple computers and want to access a single e-mail 
account.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that normally when you access your email 
on a server with an e-mail client such as Outlook it will clean the e-mail from 
the server.&nbsp; Which means that when you go to your other computer and 
attempt to access your e-mail you find that it is missing.&nbsp; The secret is 
to leave your e-mail on the server and carefully control when it is cleaned up.</p>
<p>We will create two terms to refer two types of configurations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Manager - This configuration will manage the e-mail on the server (don't 
	worry its real simple)</li>
	<li>Client - This configuration will always leave the e-mail on the server</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to make sure that you have only one manager.&nbsp; It is also 
important that your manager configuration of Outlook is one that you are going 
to use on a regular basis.&nbsp; When you have made your decisions about which 
machines are to be configured.&nbsp; The only difference between them is found 
on the &quot;More Settings...&quot; under the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab.</p>

<h3>Client Configuration</h3>
<p>Simply select the &quot;Leave a copy of messages on the server&quot; checkbox under the 
&quot;Delivery&quot; heading.</p>

<h3>Manager Configuration</h3>
<p>For the manager configuration select the &quot;Leave a copy of messages on the 
server&quot; under the &quot;Delivery&quot; section.</p>
<p>Select &quot;Remove from server after N days&quot;.&nbsp; I suggest keeping the number 
of days between 3 and 14.</p>
