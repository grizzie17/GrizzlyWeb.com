<p>by <font size="4"><i>Red Skelton</i></font></p>
<hr>
<p><i>As a schoolboy, one of Red Skelton's teachers explained the

the most outstanding speeches I ever heard in my life.&nbsp; I think it compares 
to the Sermon on the Mount, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and Socrates speech to 
the students.&nbsp; We had just finished reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and 
he called us all together.&nbsp; And he [said] ... </p>

Boys and girls, I have been listening to you recite the Pledge of Allegiance all 
semester and it seems that it has become monotonous to you--or could it be, you

recite the pledge and give you a definition for each word.</p>

  with liberty and justice for all.</font> </p>

<p>Since I was a small boy, two states have been added to our country, and two 
words have been added to the Pledge of Allegiance: <b>Under God</b>. Wouldn't it 
be a pity if someone said that is a prayer, and that [would] be eliminated from 
our 
schools, too? </p>
