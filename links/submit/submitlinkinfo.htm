      The Grizzly Web Links is a web directory.&nbsp; The directory is
      hierarchically organized according to subject -- from broad to
      specific.&nbsp; The Grizzly Web Links is maintained by real people who
      evaluate sites for inclusion in the directory.&nbsp; Each submission is
      subject to individual evaluation and review.&nbsp; We aren't a search
      engine and we pride ourselves on being highly selective.&nbsp; We don't
      accept all sites, so please don't take it personally should your site not
      be accepted. Submitting a site is easy, but we ask that you take a few
      moments to understand how to submit a site before you begin. There are few
      simple steps.&nbsp;
      <ol>
        <li>
      Please read and understand our Submission Policies before you submit
      your site. (See box to the right)&nbsp;</li>
        <li>
      Do a quick search in the <a href="../"> directory</a> to be sure your site isn't already
      listed. This saves everyone time.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Identify the single best category for your site.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Grizzly Web Links has a large set of subjects to choose from,
          and by submitting your site to the most specific category/subject, you
          help insure that your site will be reviewed by the correct person,
          thus giving your site a better chance of acceptance.&nbsp;
        <li>Once you've selected the best category for your site, go directly to
          that category and
          then click &quot;Add URL.&quot;&nbsp;
      </ul>
      </ol>

              We care a great deal about the quality of the Grizzly Web Links
              directory. Please be aware that abusive submissions will result in
              the removal of all sites connected with the abuser.&nbsp;
              <ul>
                <li>You must specify a valid email address.&nbsp; Any submission
                  that does not have a valid and reachable email address will
                  not be considered for addition to the directory.&nbsp; The specified email address is used for site
                  maintenance and will not be provided to any external
                  resources.
                <li>A valid and understandable description is necessary.&nbsp; 
                Our site evaluation process starts with reading your 
                description.&nbsp; If the description is unintelligible the site 
                will not be evaluated.&nbsp; If the description does not match 
                your real site, the submission will be rejected.<li><b>Please only submit an URL to the Grizzly Web Links once.</b>
                  If a site has not been listed within four weeks, you may
                  submit it again.
                <li>Do not submit multiple individual pages.&nbsp; Multiple page
                  submissions will be considered as submission abuse and result
                  in the removal of all sites associated with the abuser.
                <li>Submit sites to the most relevant category/page. Sites
                  intentionally submitted to inappropriate or unrelated
                  categories will not be added.
                <li>Disguising your submission and submitting the same URL more
                  than once is not permitted.<br>
                  <b>Example: http://grizzlyweb.com and http://www.grizzlyweb.com/</b>
                <li>Please do not submit mirror sites. Mirror sites are sites
                  that contain identical content, but have different URLs
                  altogether.&nbsp;
                <li>Please avoid submitting sites with addresses that redirect
                  to another address.
                <li>Sites with illegal, adult, or licentious content are forbidden in the
                  Grizzly Web Links. Examples of illegal material include, but
                  are not limited to, child pornography and sites infringing on
                  copyright.&nbsp; Examples of adult material include, sex
                  pictures, sex chat rooms, or gambling and casinos.
                <li>Wait until your site is complete before submitting your URL.
                  Sites which are incomplete, contain &quot;Under
                  Construction&quot; notices, or contain broken graphics or
                  links aren't good candidates for the directory.
                <li>Sites consisting largely of affiliate links should not be
                  submitted.</li>
                <li>At this point non-english sites are not accepted, but we
                  should be allowing them in the future.</li>
                <li>Unfortunately we will refuse sites from certain domains, due
                  to historic massive spamming from those domains.</li>
