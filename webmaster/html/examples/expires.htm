<!--
	The "expires" "http-equiv" meta-tag can be used to control
	the cacheing of pages with Netscape 3.0 and later browsers.
	The 'content="0"' form tells the browser to not cache the
	page at all.
-->
<meta http-equiv="expires" content="0">
<meta http-equiv="expires" content="Tue, 14 Mar 2000 12:45:26 GMT">
<!--
	The "pragma no-cache" http-equiv meta-tag was introduced 
	in the HTTP/1.1 specification.  Not all browsers or proxy
	agents may support these operations.  To be safe you may
	want to specify both expires and pragma in the file.
-->
<meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache">

<!--
	The "Cache-Control" http-equiv meta-tag was introduced in
	the HTTP/1.1 specification.  The allowed "content" values
	include:
	* public - may be cached in public shared caches
	* private - may only be cached in private (client) cache
	* no-cache - may not be cached
	* no-store - may be cached but no archived
	
	Cache-Control modifiers include:
	* no-transform - proxy servers are not allowed to transform
	  the cached data.
	* must-revalidate - proxy servers and other caching mechanisms
	  must revalidate the original file each time the file is
	  accessed.
	* proxy-revalidate - same as must-revalidate, but it only
	  applies to proxy servers.
	* max-age=<seconds> - client/browser is willing to accept
	  a page that is more recent than the number of seconds
	  indicated.
	* s-maxage=<seconds> - same as max-age but applies to shared
	  proxy servers and other shared caching mechanisms.
	
	The directive CACHE-CONTROL:NO-CACHE indicates cached 
	information should not be used and instead requests should 
	be forwarded to the origin server. This directive has the 
	same semantics as the PRAGMA:NO-CACHE. 
	
	Clients/Browsers SHOULD include both "pragma no-cache" and
	"cache-control no-cache" http-equiv meta-tags when used with
	a server not known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant.	
-->
<meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache, must-revalidate">

<!--
	Be aware that some search engines will remove pages from
	their indexes based on the "expires" meta-tag.  This
	implies that pages that identify a 'content="0"' form may
	not be indexed at all.
